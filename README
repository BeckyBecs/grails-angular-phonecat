# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application

## Overview

This application is based on the angular tutorial: http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index
The angular tutorial was adapted as a grails application which uses the grails plugin karma-test-runner (https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/karma-test-runner).


## Prerequisites
* nodejs
* install locally the required dependencies (go into the project root dir and execute "npm install" which will install the required depencies as defined in package.json)

## Usage
The javascript tests are located at /test/javascript/**/*.

The test classes which trigger the execution of the javascript tests you'll find at /test/unit/**/* and /test/functional/**/*.

Run "test-app" to execute the javascript tests within the grails lifecycle.
